# Bayesian Lasso Forward Continuation Ratio Model

High-dimensional variable selection for discrete survival outcomes using the Bayesian Lasso forward continuation ratio (FCR) 
model with variable inclusion indicators.

Code for a toy application is in BLASSO-FCR_SampleCode.R.

Toy data are available in the "BLASSO-FCR_SmallData.RData" file. This simulated dataset contains 447 samples and 20 genomic features. 
The first 10 features are associated with the outcome.
